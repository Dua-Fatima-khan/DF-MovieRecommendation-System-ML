# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This is my Final Year Project built as part of the Data Science course at NED University (April 2025).  
Itâ€™s a **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**-based system that predicts and recommends movies based on user preferences.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
The model takes into account features like:
- Movie genres
- User ratings
- Preference patterns

It then uses a combination of:
- **Data preprocessing techniques**
- **Machine Learning algorithms**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network)**  
to build an intelligent recommendation engine.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- MLPClassifier
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸŽ“ Outcome
This project helped me gain practical hands-on experience in:
- Data cleaning & feature selection  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Applying neural networks in real-world scenarios  

## ðŸ“œ Certificate
Certified by NED University â€“ Data Science Program 
---

> ðŸ’¡ A perfect blend of ML, deep learning, and real-world data analysis.
